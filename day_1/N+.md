# Chapter 1 - Introduction to Networking (Revision Notes)

## 1. Network Definition
- **Network:** A group of devices connected to each other to exchange data and resources.
- **Purpose:** Sharing resources (files, printers), communication, centralized management.

## 2. Why We Need Networks
- **Resource Sharing:** Printer, storage, internet.
- **Communication:** Email, chat, video call.
- **Centralized Management:** Easy monitoring, backups, security.

## 3. Network Types
| Type | Range | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| **LAN** (Local Area Network) | Small area (office/home) | Office computers |
| **MAN** (Metropolitan Area Network) | City-wide | City government network |
| **WAN** (Wide Area Network) | Country/Global | Internet |
| **CAN** (Campus Area Network) | University/Factory campus | University network |
| **SAN** (Storage Area Network) | Storage devices network | Data center storage |

## 4. Network Topologies
- **Physical vs Logical:** Physical = actual layout, Logical = data flow.
- **Common Topologies:**
  - **Bus:** Single cable, cheap, collision-prone.
  - **Ring:** Devices connected in circle, data travels one direction.
  - **Star:** All devices to central hub/switch, easy to manage.
  - **Mesh:** Devices interconnected, redundant paths, high reliability.

## 5. Network Components
- **Workstations / Hosts:** End-user devices (PCs, laptops).
- **Servers:** Provide services (files, print, email, web).
- **Switch:** Connects devices within LAN, forwards data based on MAC address.
- **Router:** Connects different networks, forwards data based on IP address.
- **Firewall:** Security device, filters traffic.
- **Access Points (AP):** Wireless connectivity for devices.
- **Cables & Media:** Copper, fiber, wireless for transmission.

## Quick Revision Tips
- Remember **LAN < MAN < WAN** size order.  
- Physical layout â‰  Logical data flow.  
- Star topology is most common in modern LANs.  
- Routers = network-to-network, Switches = device-to-device.
