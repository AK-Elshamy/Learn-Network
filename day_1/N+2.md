## 1. Network Basics üåê

* **What is a Network?**
    * A network is simply a group of two or more devices connected to each other to share data and resources.
* **Why Do We Need Networks?**
    * **Resource Sharing:** Like printers and files.
    * **Communication:** Email and instant messaging.
    * **Internet Access:** Allows users to connect to the outside world.

## 2. Network Components üõ†Ô∏è

| Component | Function | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Host** | Any device with an IP address on the network. | A computer, network printer, or phone. |
| **Workstation** | A powerful computer used by an end-user. | Your desktop computer at the office. |
| **Server** | A central computer that serves the network and provides resources. | File Server, Print Server, Web Server. |
| **Router** | Connects two different networks and directs data. | The router in your home. |
| **Switch** | Connects devices within the same local network (LAN). | The device that links computers in an office. |
| **Hub** | A simple device that connects devices, but sends data to all connected devices. | An outdated device, no longer in common use. |

## 3. Network Types (by Geographic Area) üó∫Ô∏è

* **LAN (Local Area Network):** A local network covering a small area (a building, a home).
* **WAN (Wide Area Network):** A wide network covering vast areas (a city, a country). The Internet is the biggest example of a WAN.
* **CAN (Campus Area Network):** A network covering a medium-sized geographical area like a university campus or a corporate complex.
* **SAN (Storage Area Network):** A high-speed network dedicated to data storage.

## 4. Network Design Models üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë

* **Peer-to-Peer:** No central device. All devices have equal authority and share their resources directly.
    * **Pros:** Easy to set up, inexpensive.
    * **Cons:** Difficult to manage, weak security.
* **Client-Server:** Has a central server that controls the network. Clients request resources from the server.
    * **Pros:** High security, easy management, better performance.
    * **Cons:** More expensive, single point of failure (if the server crashes).

## 5. Network Topologies (Connection Shape) üîó

* **Physical Topology:** The physical layout of cables and devices.
* **Logical Topology:** The way data flows within the network.

| Topology | Shape | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bus** | A single main cable with devices connected along it. | Easy and inexpensive. | Single point of failure (the main cable). |
| **Star** | All devices connect to a central point. | Easy to manage, a single workstation failure doesn't affect the rest of the network. | Single point of failure (the central device). |
| **Ring** | Devices are connected in a circular fashion. | Data flows in a single direction. | Single point of failure (if a cable is broken). |
| **Mesh** | Every device is connected to every other device. | Extremely reliable, multiple redundant paths. | Very expensive and complex. |
| **Hybrid** | A combination of two or more topologies. | Combines the advantages of multiple topologies. | Can be complex. |

## 6. Important Additional Concepts üí°

* **Backbone:** The "spine" of the network. It's the main cable or path that connects different **segments**.
* **Segments:** The sub-sections of a network that connect to the backbone.
* **MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching):** A modern technology used in WANs to increase the speed of data routing and prioritize traffic.
